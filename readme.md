## Methodology

This project employs a **hybrid approach** using both **GLCM and CNN-based classification**:

### 1. **GLCM-Based Classifier**

- Extracts texture features from grayscale images.
- Computes co-occurrence matrices and derives statistical features.
- Trains a machine learning model on extracted GLCM features.

### 2. **CNN-Based Classifier**

- Uses a deep learning model trained on the dataset.
- Includes image augmentation for better generalization.
- Implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for classification.

### 3. **Ensemble Approach (Future Work)**

- Combines both classifiers to improve accuracy.
- Merges texture and deep-learning features.

## Preprocessing Steps

### For **GLCM**

- Convert images to grayscale.
- Extract **contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity** features.
- Normalize extracted features for better classification.

### For **CNN**

- Resize images to **224Ã—224**.
- Normalize pixel values.
- Augment images (rotation, flipping, brightness adjustment).
- Convert images into a format suitable for CNN training.

## Model Training

- **GLCM Model:** Trained using machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, etc.).
- **CNN Model:** Implemented using **PyTorch**, trained with **GPU acceleration**.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## Installation
